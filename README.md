# managerAssistant
Project to help a manager with its calculations

### Project history

  This project was created when I talked with one of my collegues from collegue about one of our disciplines (managment). We both agreed, after my
sugestion, that the best way for both of us to pass said discipline was to create a code that would improve our ability to learn all the formulas and that
would verify our calculations. We created this project (completly in Portuguese) with that mindset and it became our main way of studing the class.

### How to run
